# Flashy

This project was made for students or anyone studying something to be able to create a deck of studying flashcards. Using flashcards can be a very effective self-testing approach. Flashcards are often part of spaced practice, and repetition helps you figure out what information you can remember easily and what needs additional effort.


## Goals

- Installing packages via NPM.
- Running tests from the command line.
- Writing React function components.
- Creating routes, including nested routes, using React Router
- Using hooks like useState(), useParams(), and useHistory().
- Debugging React code through console output and using the VS Code debugger.

## Tech Stack

**Tools:** Javascript, React

**Client:** React

**Server:** This file has data hard coded in. This was made just to test the React skills so no API was connected.
